My projects
•	Developed a Database Management System Using C modeling a database called megatron 3000 which is highly concurrent and reliable using threads and files only. Built our own record, file, storage and buffer manger to maintain the database and query handling operations.
•	Developed a Distributed Task execution Framework based on Hadoop and Swift for wordcount and grep program.
•	Developed a highly available distributed file storage application programmed using Python leveraging Google App Engine infrastructure.
•	Performed a Sentiment Analysis on the Top Trends of the week in Twitter, which in turn was used to predict sentiment of future Tweets towards the trend. 
•	Built a Distributed File System which has a Decentralized Indexing server based on a Distributed Key/Value Store in order to map the entire File System.
•	Created a Benchmarking System for CPU, GPU, Memory, Disk and Network combined.
•	Developed an Animoto Clone using Amazon Web Services which is a dynamically scalable task scheduling and execution framework based on Falkon using Python and Java by leveraging Amazon Web Services infrastructure - EC2, DynamoDB, SQS, and S3.
•	Completed the IEEE project on Cloud Computing titled “A Constraint-Based Approach for Cost-Effective Privacy Preserving of Intermediate Data Sets in Cloud” which has a main objective to make a database in a cloud, securely available to users through optimized encryption/decryption of the datasets requested.
