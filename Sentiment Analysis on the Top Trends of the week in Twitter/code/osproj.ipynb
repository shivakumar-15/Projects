Also this brings in the concept of human error also, as I am the one labelling the tweets and assigning values and the labels will be morally biased towards my view of tweets (Example a tweet which i will give a negative label, can be given a neutral or even positive label by another person). In order to get a more globalised view we would need to build a much much more complex Classifier or machine learning algorithm. This leads us to use some other way of labelling the tokens such as the SentiWordNet method."

This gives us a better way to labelling the tweets. It also has the advantage of a globally symantic view due to its predefined nature. The clash of the different human views is also avoided. Also I can use the function to label and train on more data rather than just 500 tweets and this will increase the accuracy even more."
